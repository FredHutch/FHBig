title: About FHBig
---

The Fred Hutch Bioinformatics Interest Group (FHBig) was created in 2018 by a group of people who perform hands-on bioinformatics and data analysis at the Hutch or are interested in learning. The purpose of this group is to exchange knowledge, support each other and improve collaboration and innovation across different groups at the Hutch.

## What we do
This group functions as a community organization group that facilitates:
- **Monthly meetings** where we hold lightning talks from members of the community, currently held on the first Thursday of the month at 1pm. Check our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gd30dlifri4fu7h104cuqdj0dg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) for current events.
- Maintain a **Slack workspace** for ongoing conversation support.  You can join with your fredhutch.org, UW or Sage Bionetworks email [here.](https://fhbig.slack.com)
- Host a [blog](/year-archive/) to record and announce current and upcoming events.  
- Organize and host **Pop Up Workshops** requested and lead by community members.  Look on our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gd30dlifri4fu7h104cuqdj0dg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) for events labeled "Pop Ups:" and see our Slack channel #co-working-polls to see upcoming groups or suggest your own.
- Maintain a Bioinformatics focused Google [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gd30dlifri4fu7h104cuqdj0dg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) of **selected Fred Hutch events** and relevant office hours or support resources.  
- Support building of bioinformatics documentation via the **FH Biomedical Data Science Wiki Project**.  Learn more about contributing at the [Wiki CenterNet page](https://centernet.fredhutch.org/cn/u/sciwiki.html) and see the [Wiki itself](http://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/).
