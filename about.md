# About
The purpose of FredHutch Bioinformatics Insterest Group (FHBig) is to
connect people who perform hands-on bioinformatics at the Hutch and
to exchange knowledge and support each other. We hope to improve
engagement, collaboration and innovation across different labs
within the organization.  

We hold our monthly meeting on the first Thursday of the month at 1pm in M4-A805/A817. Our activities include, but not limited to, lightning-talks, workshops, lunch, intellectual/non-intellectual discussions, collaborative work, and coffee-drinking.
