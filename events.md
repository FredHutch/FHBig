__The Future is Now: Current Topics in Biomedical Data Science and Bioinformatics Outreach for
Scientists__

### Abstract
[Ben Busby]((url: http://linkedin.com/in/dcgenomics), Ph.D, is the
Genomics Outreach Coordinator and Bioinformatics Training Lead at the
National Library of Medicine. He has an extensive background in
bioinformatics teaching, mentorship, and technical training, including
over three years; experience hosting successful data science
[hackathons](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons)  at the National
Institutes of Health. He has further facilitated the establishment of
new data science and bioinformatics training courses, seminars, and
training events nation-wide.

For his talk, Ben will discuss modern tools for the practice of data science
in biomedicine. He will cover a full range of fundamentals, including
common database structures and APIs, data extraction methods for
popular repositories, high-throughput methods for data analysis,
downstream pairing of datasets with general frameworks and systems
such as Galaxy and Bioconductor, and options for educators to
coordinate and systematize training in the form of seminars and
hackathons. Ben will contextualize this overview of data science
topics with insights from his extensive teaching and outreach
experience, for educators and trainees alike.
