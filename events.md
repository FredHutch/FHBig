# FHBig Events

## Fred Hutch Wiki Project
The Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki is now up in it's draft form at [this link.](http://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/)

We have an on-going [Wiki project](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/) of collective documentation for Genomics, Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at the Fred Hutch. We want to put a shout out to those of you who may be interested in contributing in any of the following ways:  

- Write new content on an existing or new topic (see the sidebars on each domain page to see what our current outline of topics are).
- Be an expert or novice reviewer to one of our pull requests.
- File github issues for suggested new site content, suggestions for website features or formatting, etc.
- Take 30 minutes and find as many typo’s and poor grammar as you can! #my-typo-branch
- Chime in on [FHBig Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com) in the #wiki-contributors  channel about what you like or what you see is missing.
- Meet one on one with Amy Paguirigan to collaboratively curate content about your research domain even without using GitHub or doing the writing yourself.  Amy has sat down with the Genomics Shared Resource members, the IRO and others and basically interviewed them, wrote what she perceived to be the essential material and then they edited my writing and approved it.  She can do the same for others too should that be of interest!!

We meet regularly so please contact Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) to get the current location and times or go to [the FHBig Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) and look for "Wiki Contributors Meetings" events.
