# FHBig Events

## FredHutch Wiki Project

We have an on-going [wiki project](https://fredhutch.github.io/wiki/) of collective documentation for Genomics, Bioinformatics and Scientific Computing at the Fred Hutch. We want to put a shout out to those of you who may be interested in contributing in any of the following ways:  

- Write new content on an existing or new topic (see the sidebars on each domain page to see what our current outline of topics are).
- Be an expert or novice reviewer to one of our pull requests.
- File github issues for suggested new site content, suggestions for website features or formatting, etc. 
- Take 30 minutes and find as many typo’s and poor grammar as you can! #my-typo-branch
- Chime in on [FHBig Slack](https://fhbig.slack.com) in the #wiki-contributors  channel about what you like or what you see is missing.
- Meet one on one with Amy Paguirigan to collaboratively curate content about your research domain even without using GitHub or doing the writing yourself.  Amy has sat down with the Genomics Shared Resource members and basically interviewed them, wrote what she perceived to be the essential material and then they edited my writing and approved it.  She can do the same for others too should that be of interest!!

We meet regularly on every __Thursday at 1:10 - 2pm in C2M-027__, except June 21 (C1M-025). After July 12th, the meeting room changes to M4-B104.

## FHBig lightning-talk and open discussion sessions, June 7, 2018
We attempt to have one lightning-talk session about CutAndRun-seq followd by open discussion about FHBig's future plans.

> Mike Meers from the Henikoff Lab will present a talk on analysis strategies for CUT&RUN, an epigenome profiling technique developed in the Henikoff Lab. His talk will focus on the basics of the CUT&RUN technique that are important when considering analysis approaches, comparisons with ChIP-seq analysis, and using both existing and new analysis techniques for QC, detecting enriched regions, and elucidating direct factor binding at base-pair resolution

- Speakers: Michael Meers and FHBig members
- Date: Thursday,  June 7, 2018
- Time: 1 - 2pm
- Location: M4-A805/817
