Our repo has been restructured (this post is the test of the new structure), and the gh-pages branch will house the website.  If you'd like to post to the website, please put post markdown files in the gh-pages branch, in the "posts" directory.  The master branch will house the various tools and code sharing directories that users want to create.  To do so, all of us will need to create a branch, make edits, and then submit a pull request.  All pull requests will need to be reviewed by a community member before they are merged into the master (but any of us can do that!).

Enjoy!
