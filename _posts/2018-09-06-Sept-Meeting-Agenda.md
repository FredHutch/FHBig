The next meeting for FHBig will be held on, **Thursday, Sept 6th at 1:00pm** in Arnold M4-A805/A817. Jenny Zhang will be hosting a discussion on deploying Shiny applications using the Fred Hutch pipeline developed by Scientific Computing. [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an open source R package that provides a framework for building web applications; Shiny can be used to transform data analyses into interactive web applications without needing to code in HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

In addition, Jenny will provide a demonstration of the workflow with detailed explanation about each step in the process. This will be followed by an interactive Pop-Up Session led by Jenny on *Friday Sept. 7th at 12pm in M4-A220*. This would be a great opportunity to learn about Shiny and its many uses, then get some hands-on experience in the Pop-Up.   

 **Agenda for Talks/Demos**:
1.	Deploying A Shiny Application using the Fred Hutch Pipeline, by Jenny Zhang

This will be a structured discussion with a moderator to assist with questions and ensure that as many questions as possible are answered in detail.
