Starting the week of 9/4, we'd like to kick off more Pop Up workshops!!!  So, those of you posting polls in the #co-working-polls channel on Slack and looking for a place to host those, please contact Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) and we'll get you set up in our large shared office.  Anyone interested in hosting a tutorial on a cool technique they found or want to offer "office hours" for the community, this is your space! Ideally events would be no more than 1.5 hours long, primarily on Tuesdays or Thursdays and I *may* ask you in exchange to make some documents related to the workshop shared via the [sciwiki.fredhutch.org](http://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) site. :wink:

The room is M4-A220 in the Arnold Building and I can offer up a monitor, computer (mac or pc), a marker board, and a table for up to about 6-7 people for Pop Up workshops or office hours.

You can find up to date events by going to [the FHBig Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2QzMGRsaWZyaTRmdTdoMTA0Y3VxZGowZGdAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) and looking for those events labeled "Pop Up:...".  If you'd like to get on the roster, please email Amy Paguirigan (`apaguiri`) or go chat about it on [Slack.](https://fhbig.slack.com)
