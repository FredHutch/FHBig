Almost a year ago we organized two community meetings and set up goals for FHBig. Together we have built a supportive community encouraging knowledge exchange and cross-group cooperation. Here are some highlights of our effort in 2018:

- two community meetings
- created communication channel: gh-pages (fhbig.io), slack, and email list
