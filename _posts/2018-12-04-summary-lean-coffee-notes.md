activities and direction.  Below is a summary of
all the sticky notes that we gathered:

- A lot of different groups forming/extablisedh. How to integerate or not?
- Topics in data science you are passinate about or interested in
- Building pipleline on AWS  
- Should FHBig invite peple from UW/ISB/Allen, etc?  
- HACKATHONS  
- Protips for commonly used programs like _picard_, _granges_, and etc
- How do we start having office hours?
- Should FHBig organize tutorials?
- Technical application focused groups?
- More lightning talk on demo of people's day-to-day work
- Journal club and its co-ordinators?

## Follow-up

- create co-working-polls to find peple interested in methyl-seq and methods?
- have pop-up workshops for day-to-day works such as Bioconductor 101 and other topics?
