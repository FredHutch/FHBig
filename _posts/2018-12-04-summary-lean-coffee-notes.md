On October 4th, 2018, FHBig hosted a lean coffee meeting 
gathering thoughts from our members about FHBig's future 
activities and direction.  Below is the summary and follow-ups:

- Better use of Beagle on Rhino/Gizmo  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> SciWiki has a page about beagle usage: <a href="https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/infdemos/how_to_beagle/">How to Beagle</a>.
  </p>
</div> 

- Illumina's methyl-seq and other methylation methods?   
<div class="notice--warning" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontfamily:courier;fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Action:</strong> Should we create a co-working poll asking people around?
  </p>

<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> COOP is working on integrating groups with similar insterest (bioinformatics and data science) .
  </p>

- Building pipelines on AWS  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> SciComp/Sam/Amy/Jenny huddle up to build workflow on AWS using scientific workflow engine. 
  </p>
</div> 

- Should FHBig invite peple from UW/ISB/Allen, etc?  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> We already have members from other institution. Please invide people who are interested in FHBig.

<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> We will start our first journal club on Feb. and discuss DNA-seq data. Please make proposal on <a href="https://fhbig.slack.com">slace</a> so that we can keep the journal club going.
  </p>

## Miscellaneous topics
- Should FHBig organize tutorials?
- Topics in data science you are passinate about or interested in
- Protips for commonly used programs like _picard_, _granges_, and etc
- More lightning talk on demo of people's day-to-day work
- Technical application focused groups?
- How do we start office hour?
- Journal club


### Follow-up 
- Find experts of _picard_ and _bioconductor_ and offer pop-up workshops
- Create co-working-polls to find peple interested in methyl-seq and methods
- Organize pop-up workshops for day-to-day works and journal clubs. But what specific topics should we cover? Please post requests on `#co-working-poll` or even `#general` channel on [slack](https://fhbig.slack.com) and we can ask local experts to help us.
- It is highly encouraged to create an interest and co-working group of your interest. The blog post, [How to Start a Co-working Group](https://fredhutch.github.io/FHBig/How-To-Start-Co-Working-Groups/), suggests the tactics and resources.
