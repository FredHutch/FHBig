On October 4th, 2018, FHBig hosted a lean coffee meeting 
gathering thoughts from our members about FHBig's future 
activities and direction.  Below is the summary:

- Better use of Beagle on Rhino/Gizmo  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> SciWiki has a page about beagle usage: <a href="https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/infdemos/how_to_beagle/">How to Beagle</a>.
  </p>
</div> 

- Illumina's methyl-seq and other methylation methods?   
<div class="notice--warning" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontfamily:courier;fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Action:</strong> Should we create a co-working poll asking people around?
  </p>

<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> COOP is working on integrating groups with similar insterest (bioinformatics and data science) .
  </p>
</div> 

- Building pipelines on AWS  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> SciComp/Sam/Amy/Jenny huddle up to build workflow on AWS using scientific workflow engine. 
  </p>
</div> 

- Should FHBig invite peple from UW/ISB/Allen, etc?  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> We already have members from other institution. Please invide people who are interested in FHBig.
  </p>

- HACKATHONS  
<div class="notice--success" style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="fontsize: 140%;"><strong>Follow-up:</strong> The COOP is hosting a community-focused NCBI-style Hackathon in February. Propose a project <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZ7glWMtTgQJ6spUGyvHRQSKzoxeLhNtZbsSdCQbE6-Q2biQ/viewform">here</a>.
  </p>
</div> 

- Should FHBig organize tutorials?
- Topics in data science you are passinate about or interested in
- Protips for commonly used programs like _picard_, _granges_, and etc
- More lightning talk on demo of people's day-to-day work
- Technical application focused groups?
- How do we start having office hours?
- Journal club and its co-ordinators?


## Follow-up
- find experts of _picard_ and _bioconductor_?
- create co-working-polls to find peple interested in methyl-seq and methods?
- have pop-up workshops for day-to-day works such as Bioconductor 101 and other topics?
- What tutorial we need? Post request on co-working poll channel?
