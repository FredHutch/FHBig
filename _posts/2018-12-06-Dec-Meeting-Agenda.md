The next meeting for FHBig will be held **Thursday, December 6th** at 1:00pm in Arnold M4-A805/A817.  This meeting will be a more informal get-together with local beers and Ballard Company Pizza provided for all, to celebrate a year of FHBig and the progress of the Wiki Project.  

**Agenda:**
1.	Pizza and Beer
2.	Announcements (there are some big changes, so please read the details below)
3.	Open Discussion on FHBig Activities and Direction

**Details**

This will be an end of the year celebration to commemorate the first year of FHBig and the time members have spent working hard to organize lightning talks, co-working groups, book clubs, and so much more.  Also we will be celebrating a new phase of the Biomedical Data Science Wiki Project, including an announcement of new Wiki Writer-Editor openings.  A huge thanks to Wiki leader Amy Paguirigan for providing funds for the party. üòä

We will have some announcements about the new directions and possibilities for FHBig in the next year.  We will discuss some changes to group resources, including a **re-branding of the Slack workspace to ‚ÄúThe Coop Communities‚Äù**, to be more inclusive of all things data science and cast a wider, more inclusive net to others at the Fred Hutch and nearby institutions.  We are excited about our collaboration with The Coop as it begins to take shape.  FHBig has agreed to support peer-to-peer communications and events that foster community much as it has done over the past year via working groups, lightening talks, Slack chats and the FHBig blog.  
We will hold an open discussion of the FHBig mission statement and discuss how our activities will help us meet that mission statement.
