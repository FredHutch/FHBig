title: Three Useful Channels in the FHBig Slack

How can you receive information and communicate with FHBig members
without exploring hundreds of conversations across several Slack
channels? These three channels can save you some hassle: `#general`,
`#co-working-polls` and `#question-and-answer`.

## `#general`
We use this channel to make announcements, display the weekly calendar and ask general questions. It’s a great place to make your voice reach most FHBig members.

## `#co-working-polls`
This channel is for curating ideas for co-working projects, forming or
joining co-working groups/journal clubs, and finding lunch
buddies. You are strongly encouraged to create a poll and find people
with similar interests. Here is an example of making a poll:

```
/poll Who wants to join a journal club on Thursday, October 18
at 1am at Arnold’s Atrium “Yes” “Maybe”
```
## `#question-and-answer`
This is the place to ask questions related to scientific computing, bioinformatics, data sciences, programming or anything technical/academic. And please share your knowledge here as well. 

## More info
- __How to send notification to all members on the channel?__  You can
  _mention_ everyone by `@everyone` or `@channel`.
- __How to send private messages?__ `Direct Messages` allows you to send private messages to one or multiple members.
- __How to share some interesting paper?__  Share with us on `#papers` channel!
- __Interested in hackathon?__ Some members have started conversation
  on `#hackathon` already. 
- __How to announce to a new channel is created?__ Please announce and _mention_ everyone on `#general`.
- __Who can join the Slack?__ Anyone with `@fredhutch.org`, `@sage.org`, and `@uw.edu` email. Any member can send invitation to whom are interested in joining.
