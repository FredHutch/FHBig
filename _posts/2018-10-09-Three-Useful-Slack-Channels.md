How can you receive information and communicate with COOP Community members
without exploring hundreds of conversations across several Slack
channels? These three channels can save you some hassle: `#general`,
`#co-working-polls` and `#question-and-answer`.

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> Anyone who has <code class="highlighter-rouge">@fredhutch.org</code>,  <code class="highlighter-rouge">@sagebase.org</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">@sharp.org</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">@uw.edu</code> email address can join without invitation. The list can be expended upon request.</p>

## `#general`
We use this channel to make announcements, display the weekly calendar and ask general questions. It’s a great place to make your voice reach most COOP/FHBig members.

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> To mention or notify everyone on the channel, embed <a href="#">@everyone</a> or <a href="#">@channel</a> in your message. </p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>ProTip:</strong> Threads allow us to reply directly to a message, preserve context and encourage conversation without distracting a channel's flow.  To start a thread, hover over the message and click the <strong>Start a thread icon</strong>. </p>

## `#co-working-polls`
This channel is for curating ideas for co-working projects, forming or
joining co-working groups/journal clubs, and finding lunch
buddies. You are strongly encouraged to create a poll and find people
with similar interests. Here is an example of making a poll:

```
/poll Who wants to join a journal club on Thursday, October 18
at 1am at Arnold’s Atrium? “Yes” “Maybe”
```

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Info:</strong> If you form your group of interest and need a meetup space, email Amy Paguirigan, <code class="highlighter-rouge">apaguiri@fredhutch.org</code>. </p>

## `#question-and-answer`
This is the place to ask questions related to scientific computing, bioinformatics, statistics, data sciences, programming or anything technical/academic. And please help us and share your knowledge here as well.
