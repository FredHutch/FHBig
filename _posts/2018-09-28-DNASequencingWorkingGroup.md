A new DNA Sequencing Working Group Pop Up has been scheduled!!!

This Pop Up working group will be a regular event focused on those of us working with (or intending to work with) DNA sequencing data.  The issues associated with choosing bioinformatic workflows for analysis of WGS to WES to targeted DNA sequencing with or without paired (or multi-locus) samples will be discussed.

No previous experience necessary, however we do ask that you currently have an ongoing project involving DNA sequencing data analysis OR are intending to begin one in the near future.  This will be a collaborative discussion and will include novel approaches including assessments of intratumoral heterogeneity/subclonality.

Scheduled at 1130-1230 on Tuesdays, every 2 weeks starting 10/9.  See the [event on our Calendar for location and updates.](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MWs4MGpsdG5sN2NtNnJtODdkcmZpbWFpaXBfMjAxODEwMDlUMTgzMDAwWiBnZDMwZGxpZnJpNGZ1N2gxMDRjdXFkajBkZ0Bn&tmsrc=gd30dlifri4fu7h104cuqdj0dg%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)
