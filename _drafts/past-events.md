## Data Science Affinity Group and FHBig Seminar, May 21, 2018
__The Future is Now: Current Topics in Biomedical Data Science and Bioinformatics Outreach for
Scientists__

### Abstract
[Ben Busby](http://linkedin.com/in/dcgenomics), Ph.D, is the
Genomics Outreach Coordinator and Bioinformatics Training Lead at the
National Library of Medicine. He has an extensive background in
bioinformatics teaching, mentorship, and technical training, including
over three years; experience hosting successful data science
[hackathons  at the National Institutes of Health](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons). He 
has further facilitated the establishment of new data science and
bioinformatics training courses, seminars, and training events nation-wide.

For his talk, Ben will discuss modern tools for the practice of data science
in biomedicine. He will cover a full range of fundamentals, including
common database structures and APIs, data extraction methods for
popular repositories, high-throughput methods for data analysis,
downstream pairing of datasets with general frameworks and systems
such as Galaxy and Bioconductor, and options for educators to
coordinate and systematize training in the form of seminars and
hackathons. Ben will contextualize this overview of data science
topics with insights from his extensive teaching and outreach
experience, for educators and trainees alike.

## FHBig Lightning-talk, May 3, 2018
__Intro to the Translational Genomics Data Commons__

This lightening talk will be a quick overview of the progress the Translational Genomics Data Coordination Center has made in integrating systems to coordinate data collection, management and bioinformatics at the Fred Hutch.  The platform employs a modular suite of tools to capture and coordinate data from the level of human specimen banking all the way through the laboratory and the cloud to a [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/) based Data Commons. After the overview there will be time for questions and suggestions.  The group is currently beginning the process of identifying possible groups to collaborate to pilot the system
